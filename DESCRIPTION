Description: An implementation of an algorithm family for continuous
    optimization called memetic algorithms with local search chains
    (MA-LS-Chains), as proposed in Molina et al. (2010) <doi:10.1162/evco.2010.18.1.18102> and Molina et al. (2011) <doi:10.1007/s00500-010-0647-2>. Rmalschains is further discussed in Bergmeir et al. (2016) <doi:10.18637/jss.v075.i04>. Memetic algorithms are hybridizations of genetic
    algorithms with local search methods. They are especially suited
    for continuous optimization.
